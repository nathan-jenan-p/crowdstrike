## Creating a Client ID / Client Secret

Before using the Polarity Crowdstrike Integration you will need to create a Client ID and Client Secret to connect to Crowdstrike with.  The following steps will guide you through the process:

1. Log onto the Crowdstrike Falcon console.
2. Go to `Support > API Client and Keys`.
3. Click `Add New API Client`.
4. A dialog will appear, enter the name of the integration (e.g. `Polarity`) and a description (optional).
5. Polarity will need `Read` access to both `Containment` and `Detection`, so make sure to click both checkboxes. 
6. Click `Add`. Record the Client ID and Client Secret (Client secret will only be shown once for security purpose, so make sure to store it in a secure place).

Use the Client ID and Client Secret that you recorded previously to fill out the integration options. You are now ready to use the Polarity integration with Crowdstrike!
